<msg type="warning" file="Xst" num="647" delta="new" >Input &lt;<arg fmt="%s" index="1">DM_Addr&lt;1:0&gt;</arg>&gt; is never used. This port will be preserved and left unconnected if it belongs to a top-level block or it belongs to a sub-block and the hierarchy of this sub-block is preserved.

<msg type="info" file="Xst" num="3218" delta="new" >HDL ADVISOR - The RAM &lt;<arg fmt="%s" index="1">Mram_seg</arg>&gt; will be implemented on LUTs either because you have described an asynchronous read or because of currently unsupported block RAM features. If you have described an asynchronous read, making it synchronous would allow you to take advantage of available block RAM resources, for optimized device usage and improved timings. Please refer to your documentation for coding guidelines.

<msg type="info" file="Xst" num="2169" delta="new" >HDL ADVISOR - Some clock signals were not automatically buffered by XST with BUFG/BUFR resources. Please use the buffer_type constraint in order to insert these buffers to the clock signals to help prevent skew problems.
